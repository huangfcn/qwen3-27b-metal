# Qwen3.8-27B on Apple M3 Pro

This target runs Qwen3.8-27B text generation end to end through a model-specific C runtime and Metal kernels. It supports batched prompt prefill, incremental conversation state, FP16 KV cache, greedy and sampled decoding, adaptive MTP speculative decoding and streaming output.

## Target and artifact

| Property | Pinned value |
|---|---|
| Machine | MacBook Pro `Mac15,6` |
| SoC | Apple M3 Pro, 11-core CPU, 14-core Metal 3 GPU |
| Memory | 36 GB unified memory |
| Operating system | macOS 15.7.3 |
| Weight format | affine Q4, group size 64 |
| Compiled text image | 65 mapped files, 15,138,643,968 bytes, plus tokenizer |
| MTP images | 209,436,672-byte draft layer and 29,556,736-byte projection/norm image |
| Runtime state | 158.9 MB recurrent/convolution state; FP16 KV uses 64 KiB per context token |

The target maps immutable layer images rather than loading a general model graph. Forty-eight DeltaNet layers use persistent recurrent/convolution state; sixteen full-attention layers use grouped-query KV cache. Metal kernels are specialized for the fixed matrix shapes, affine Q4 layout and prompt-length buckets used by this graph.

## Source layout

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| This directory | C/Objective-C runtime, image-format headers and Metal kernels |
| [`commands/`](../commands/) | Chat and one-shot generation front ends compiled into `build/` |
| [`compiler/`](../compiler/) | Offline checkpoint inspection, packing, quantizers and the image-compile driver |

## Compiled image format

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `global.q38global` | embedding, final normalization and output projection |
| `layer-NN.q38delta` | one DeltaNet transformer layer |
| `layer-NN.q38att` | one full-attention transformer layer |
| `tokenizer.q38tok` | packed vocabulary, merges and special-token tables |
| `mtp-layer.q38att` | MTP draft attention layer |
| `mtp.q38mtp` | MTP input projection and normalization tensors |

Every packer checks the expected source SHA-256 before writing an image. Every image carries its format magic, version, source hash and tensor metadata; the runtime rejects the wrong model or format instead of attempting compatibility fallback.

## Build the runtime

Apple Metal command-line tools and a C11/Objective-C compiler are required.

```sh
make qwen38-m3-chat qwen38-tools qwen38-mtp-pack
```

## Compile the model images

Download the exact pinned revisions (the packers re-check every SHA-256), then compile the three weight shards and tokenizer:

```sh
python compiler/qwen38_q8_quantize_all.py \
    /path/to/qwen38-bf16/model.safetensors.index.json \
    ./tmp/q8_all

compiler/qwen38_compile_runtime_images.sh \
  model-00001-of-00003.safetensors \
  model-00002-of-00003.safetensors \
  model-00003-of-00003.safetensors \
  tokenizer.json \
  /path/to/qwen38-runtime ./tmp/q8_all

rm -fr ./tmp/q8_all
```

Pack the standalone MTP checkpoint into the same directory:

```sh
build/qwen38-m3-attention-pack \
  /path/to/qwen38-mtp/model.safetensors \
  /path/to/qwen38-runtime/mtp-layer.q38att \
  76663c101e7e8ea9c0ae17bcb95183cd7f733ce424c912b8b264a7b1c48e4cc6 64

build/qwen38-mtp-pack \
  /path/to/qwen38-mtp/model.safetensors \
  /path/to/qwen38-runtime/mtp.q38mtp \
  76663c101e7e8ea9c0ae17bcb95183cd7f733ce424c912b8b264a7b1c48e4cc6
```

## Run

Resident terminal chat:

```sh
QWEN38_MODEL_DIR=/path/to/qwen38-runtime commands/qwen38_chat.sh --terminal
```

One prompt:

```sh
QWEN38_MODEL_DIR=/path/to/qwen38-runtime \
  commands/qwen38_chat.sh 'Explain why virtual memory uses pages.'
```

OpenAI-compatible server:

```sh
python server/qwen38_serve.py --model-dir /path/to/qwen38-runtime --port 8080 --thinking --context 98304 --max-tokens 20480
# base URL: http://127.0.0.1:8199/v1
```

The server accepts standard sampling fields. `reasoning_effort` values `low`, `medium` and `xhigh` enable thinking mode; `none` selects the no-thinking template. Streaming responses separate reasoning into `reasoning_content` and the final answer into `content`. The Python process implements only HTTP and template adaptation; inference stays inside the resident C/Metal process.

## Codex CLI

`server/codex-qwen` runs the OpenAI Codex CLI against this runtime instead of a
hosted model. It starts the server if needed and then execs
`codex -p qwen`, which layers `~/.codex/qwen.config.toml` over the user
config. Every argument is forwarded, so `codex-qwen`, `codex-qwen exec '...'`
and `codex-qwen resume --last` all work.

```sh
codex-qwen                                    # interactive
codex-qwen exec 'fix the bug in calc.py'      # one shot
```

Codex 0.149 dropped `wire_api = "chat"` and speaks only the Responses API, so
`qwen38_serve.py` also serves `POST /v1/responses`. The shim renders a
Responses request into the same Qwen3.8 chat template - including the
template's own `<tool_call><function=...><parameter=...>` block - and turns
the reply back into the SSE events Codex consumes: `response.created`,
`response.output_text.delta`, `response.reasoning_text.delta`,
`response.output_item.added`/`.done` and `response.completed`. Codex ignores
`response.function_call_arguments.delta`, so each tool call is delivered whole
in one `output_item.done` carrying a `function_call` item. Both APIs share one
resident engine, so Chatbox and Codex can point at the same server.

Rendering is deliberately append-only: instructions and leading developer
messages become the system turn, assistant and `function_call` items replay as
assistant turns, and `function_call_output` items become `<tool_response>`
blocks. Each Codex turn is therefore an exact token extension of the previous
one, and the engine's conversation continuation prefills only the new suffix.

That covers turns inside one session. A new session shares nothing with the
conversation the turn checkpoint holds, so it used to re-prefill the whole
10.4 k-token preamble. The shim therefore also declares a `prefix` with each
request - the span it knows repeats verbatim in every session for this
workspace - and the runtime keeps a second checkpoint slot there. See
The prefix-checkpoint API for why
that has to live in the runtime.

On an opening turn the declared prefix is the system turn plus Codex's own
preamble (recommended plugins, environment context), which is 10,399 of the
10,416 tokens; only the user's sentence is new. Later turns declare just the
system turn, because the conversation in flight belongs to the turn checkpoint
and writing it into the session slot would make that slot session-specific.

Starting a session:

| Session | Prompt tokens | Reused | Time to first token |
|---|---|---|---|
| First after the model loads | 10,416 | 0 | 235.5 s |
| Second, same workspace | 10,416 | 10,399 | 1.7 s |
| Third | 10,416 | 10,399 | 1.8 s |

A complete edit task in one of those sessions - fix a function that subtracts
where it should add - with both checkpoints in play:

| Turn | Prompt tokens | Reused | Time to first token | Emitted |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Read the file | 10,439 | 10,399 | 3.4 s | `exec_command` |
| Apply the patch | 10,536 | 10,467 | 2.9 s | `exec_command` |
| Verify | 10,667 | 10,536 | 4.9 s | `exec_command` |
| Answer | 10,765 | 10,698 | 3.0 s | final message |

Measured on the pinned machine with `QWEN38_CONTEXT=32768`, decoding at
12-23 tok/s. The cold turn is prefill-bound at roughly 44 tok/s. It is paid
once per server, not once per session: the first `codex-qwen` after the model
loads waits about four minutes, and every session after it starts in under two
seconds.

The session slot mirrors its own KV span, so an unrelated request in between -
even one that resets the caches - does not cost it. Only another prompt of at
least `QWEN38_PREFIX_MIN` tokens (2048 by default) can take the slot, which is
what keeps a short side request from evicting an agent preamble. Two different
agents pointed at one server will still take it from each other.

`QWEN38_CONTINUE_DEBUG=1` prints which checkpoint each request matched,
`QWEN38_DUMP_PROMPT=<dir>` writes every rendered prompt and its declared prefix,
and every request logs a time-to-first-token breakdown over restore, prefill,
forward and checkpoint save.

### opencode

`server/opencode-qwen` is the same arrangement for [opencode](https://opencode.ai):
it brings the server up and then runs opencode against it, with
`OPENCODE_CONFIG` pointed at `~/.config/opencode/qwen.json` so the user's normal
config - other providers, MCP servers - is left alone and adds no tokens here.

```sh
opencode-qwen                                    # interactive
opencode-qwen run 'fix the bug in calc.py'       # one shot
```

opencode speaks chat completions through `@ai-sdk/openai-compatible`, so
`/v1/chat/completions` renders the template's tool block, replays assistant
`tool_calls` and turns `role: "tool"` messages into `<tool_response>` blocks,
exactly as the Responses path does. Its system turn is declared as the
checkpoint prefix too. A measured edit task - read the file, patch it, verify -
ran its eleven tools at 11.7 k prompt tokens:

| Turn | Prompt tokens | Reused | Time to first token | Emitted |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Session start | 11,687 | 11,650 | 2.1 s | `read` |
| Apply the patch | 11,819 | 11,730 | 3.8 s | `edit` |
| Verify | 11,932 | 11,819 | 4.8 s | `bash` |
| Answer | 12,011 | 11,995 | 1.8 s | final message |

opencode asks a separate ~560-token question of the `small_model` to title each
session. Pointed at this server that costs about 9 s twice per session, and it
resets the engine - which is what the session slot's KV mirror and prefix floor
exist to survive. Pointing `small_model` at a different provider avoids the
18 s but sends the titles off the machine.

### What the turn time is made of

Profiling a four-turn edit task showed the checkpoint machinery costs nothing
worth optimizing - restore 0.00-0.30 s, save 0.01-0.04 s - and the single
forward that produces the first token is a flat 0.17 s. Everything else is
prefill of the new suffix, and decode.

Decode is the part that scales with the conversation, because every step
attends over the whole KV cache. Measured on a fixed 200-token generation:

| Context | Decode |
|---|---|
| 1,314 tokens | 9.9 tok/s |
| 5,154 tokens | 9.3 tok/s |
| 12,834 tokens | 6.5 tok/s |

So prompt size is not only a one-off prefill cost; it is a tax on every token
generated afterwards. The runtime's own speed knobs - `QWEN38_MTP_DEPTH`,
`QWEN38_VERIFY_FAST`, `QWEN38_VERIFY_WIDE`, `QWEN38_DRAFT_VOCAB`,
`QWEN38_PREFILL_MMA`, `QWEN38_PREFILL_MAX_CHUNK` - are already at the values
`results.json` (kept with the benchmark records in the upstream `llm-in-c` repository) measured as best, so the prompt is where the
remaining speed is.

`QWEN38_PIN_WEIGHTS` pins the mmap'd weight images in RAM (default: auto).
The weights are file-backed page-cache pages, and the MTP verify stream - a
full pass over every weight byte per accepted token - evicts most of the
~15 GB between prefill chunks; each chunk then re-faults from the NVMe at a
few GB/s, which is why prefill plateaus around 45 tok/s regardless of chunk
shape. Pinning makes every chunk read at memory bandwidth instead, so long
prefills should drop from minutes to single-digit seconds on machines where
it engages. Auto mode pins only when physical RAM holds the weights plus
this model's KV cache plus a 6 GB headroom for the OS, server and GPU working
set (a 36 GB machine pins; an 18 GB one does not). `=1` forces it, `=0`
disables it; if `mlock` is refused the forced mode falls back to reading the
pages into the cache once at open (warmed, not pinned) and says so on stderr.

`QWEN38_KV_Q8=1` stores the attention KV cache as Q8_0 instead of fp16
(opt-in, unmeasured here). Each 256-dim head vector becomes 256 int8 codes
plus one fp32 scale - 260 bytes instead of 512 - so the KV memory and its
read traffic roughly halve: at a 65536 context the main model's cache drops
from ~4.3 GB to ~2.2 GB, and the MTP layer's identical cache does the same,
freeing ~4 GB in total. Quantization happens once at write (the decode and
prefill writers share it, so both paths stay consistent); the readers
dequantize inline, with the per-vector scale factored out of the Q.K dot
product. K and V get independent scales, each using the full [-127, 127]
code range against its own maximum - finer-grained than llama.cpp's 32-
element q8_0 blocks. Expect at worst a small perplexity bump (Q8_0 KV is
standard practice in llama.cpp's `--cache-type-k q8_0`); on this greedy
temperature-0 runtime the risk is occasional token flips on long contexts,
so compare one normal session against the fp16 default before relying on it.
The MTP layer, prefix checkpoint mirrors and the reset path all follow the
same layout automatically. Unset or `=0` keeps the byte-identical fp16 path.

Three prefill knobs are opt-in and unmeasured here. `QWEN38_PREFILL_MAX_CHUNK=512`
widens the default 128-row chunks to 512-row trunks (half-tile GEMM levels
only): a full pass streams every mapped weight byte, so four times as many
tokens per stream should amortize better on long prompts; the trunk runs on
its own lazily allocated workspace whose scores buffer is 4x the 128-row one
and grows with the context capacity (about 3 GB at 128k), and its MTP
draft-cache refresh runs on that same workspace. `QWEN38_FLASH_PREFILL=1`
replaces the two-pass prefill attention (materialize the full batch x
context scores matrix, then a separate softmax + P.V pass over it) with a
single-pass flash-attention kernel: one threadgroup per (row, q-head)
streams the KV cache in 24-position blocks with an online softmax, so the
scores matrix is never written to or re-read from device memory and the
attention cost of a chunk stops growing super-linearly with the context
length. It follows `QWEN38_KV_Q8` automatically (a Q8 variant dequantizes
K/V inline) and applies to both the prompt chunks and the MTP verify
replay. The arithmetic order differs from the two-pass path, so it is
gated by the same token-parity standard as the MMA GEMMs - run one normal
session against the default before relying on it. `QWEN38_PREFILL_PROGRESS=1`
prints one line to stderr each time a quarter of the fill is crossed
(25/50/75%) plus a final 100% line - at most four lines per prefill, with
the running percentage and tok/s - so a long silent prefill can be
followed from the terminal.

`QWEN38_STRIP_BLOCKS` drops named `<block>...</block>` spans from Codex's
context messages before rendering. It defaults to `recommended_plugins`, a
1,842-token list of plugins that are neither installed nor enabled in this
profile: the model cannot act on it, so removing it cannot cost capability.
The same task run before and after, with everything else fixed:

| | 10,416-token prompt | 8,574-token prompt |
|---|---|---|
| Cold prefill | 235.1 s | 181.1 s |
| Turn time to first token | 2.8 / 3.1 / 4.9 / 3.2 s | 2.5 / 3.4 / 4.5 / 3.0 s |
| Decode | 12.1 / 10.4 / 14.2 / 12.7 tok/s | 12.4 / 10.0 / 15.3 / 13.7 tok/s |

The model behaved identically across the two runs - same three `exec_command`
calls, same 28/71/58/63 generated tokens, same 22/53/47/51 MTP accepts over
6/22/12/14 steps - which is the evidence that the removed tokens were dead
weight rather than context the model was using.

Naming `skills_instructions` in `QWEN38_STRIP_BLOCKS` saves a further ~800
tokens, but those skills exist on disk and the model could otherwise invoke
them, so that one is a real trade and stays off by default.

The profile exists to keep that first prefill survivable. A stock Codex turn
sends about 60,000 tokens of tool schema alone (GitHub 76 KB, Gmail 33 KB and
Sites 30 KB of JSON), so `~/.codex/qwen.config.toml` disables apps, plugins,
MCP servers, web search and subagents, leaving 12 tools and 10.4 k tokens. It
also sets `model_context_window` and `model_auto_compact_token_limit` so Codex
compacts before the runtime refuses the prompt, and a 15-minute
`stream_idle_timeout_ms` because a cold prefill outlasts the default.

Thinking is off by default: at this token rate a reasoning block per tool call
is not affordable. Set `QWEN38_RESPONSES_EFFORT=1` on the server to honor the
request's `reasoning.effort` instead.

## Verification

Verification is separate from timed benchmarking.

| Gate | Recorded result |
|---|---|
| Source integrity | Three weight shards, tokenizer and MTP checkpoint SHA-256 checked at pack time |
| Image identity | 68/68 runtime files use Qwen3.8 names and `.q38*` formats; sampled headers report `Q38M3GLB`, `Q38TOK1`, `Q38M3Q4`, `Q38M3ATT` and `Q38M3MTP` |
| Async decode API | 16/16 state-machine checks pass |
| Batched prefill parity | 36/36 checks pass across 12 lengths from 16 to 131 tokens and three execution modes; argmax identical and no NaN |
| Basic generation | `2+2` → `4`; C `max2` implementation correct; Chinese capital-of-France prompt → `巴黎` |
| MTP image smoke | `one` through `ten` generated correctly; 19 visible tokens at 13.0 decode tok/s, with 13 drafts accepted over 7 steps |
| Speculative decoding | Default fast verify token-identical to plain greedy on 3/5 throughput cases; prose and essay each flip one numerical near-tie onto an alternate fluent greedy continuation; `QWEN38_VERIFY_FAST=0` selects the exact verify with 5/5 token identity |
| Thinking stream | Reasoning and answer split verified; `reasoning_effort: none` reproduces no-thinking behavior |
| ARC-Easy five-case adaptation | 3/5 strict at a 32-token budget, 4/5 at 96; misses contain the correct content but do not complete the required `Answer: X` format |

The ARC-Easy record is a small generative smoke adaptation, not an official ARC-Easy score. Raw outputs are in the `arc-easy-5` records in the upstream `llm-in-c` repository.

## Measured throughput

The following five workloads ran through one resident chat process per arm with greedy seed 42. End-to-end throughput is completion tokens divided by the full request wall, including prompt prefill, first token and decode. The speculative arm uses adaptive MTP with replay-free partial accepts, a wide-tile eight-wide half-MMA verify, a depth-7 chain ceiling, four-gram context-lookup drafting and a restricted draft-head vocabulary.

| Case | Output tokens | Plain end-to-end | Adaptive MTP end-to-end | Speedup | Request wall, plain / MTP |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| C `max2` function | 28 | 6.36 tok/s | **15.01 tok/s** | 2.36× | 4.4 / 1.9 s |
| Hash-table explanation | 531 / 524 | 8.19 tok/s | **10.84 tok/s** | 1.32× | 64.8 / 48.3 s |
| Python `LRUCache` class | 1,155 | 7.98 tok/s | **17.59 tok/s** | 2.20× | 144.7 / 65.7 s |
| Virtual-memory essay | 1,463 | 8.01 tok/s | **9.94 tok/s** | 1.24× | 182.7 / 147.2 s |
| Notes summary, 159-token prompt | 128 | 6.99 tok/s | **9.87 tok/s** | 1.41× | 18.3 / 13.0 s |
| **Aggregate** | **3,305 / 3,298** | **7.96 tok/s** | **11.95 tok/s** | **1.50×** | **415.0 / 276.0 s** |

Aggregate decode throughput is 8.06 plain and 12.32 speculative. Code-heavy cases run at 18.0–40.8 decode tok/s because their draft chains accept deeply; prose cases sit near 10.0–11.0, acceptance-limited. Four cases are token-identical between arms; the paired token count marks the prose case where the fast verify's accumulation order flips one numerical near-tie onto an alternate fluent greedy continuation. `QWEN38_VERIFY_FAST=0` selects the exact verify kernels, which are token-identical on all five cases at 9.81 aggregate end-to-end tok/s.

## llama.cpp comparison

A separate comparison used the same rendered 36-token prompt and 28-token greedy completion with both models resident. Each stack received one warmup followed by four measured requests. llama.cpp build 10360 used `unsloth/Qwen3.8-27B-GGUF` Q4_K_M, which is a different four-bit encoding from this runtime's affine Q4 checkpoint.

| Metric | This runtime, plain | This runtime, adaptive MTP | llama.cpp + Q4_K_M |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| End-to-end throughput | 6.29 tok/s | **9.01 tok/s** | 5.76 tok/s |
| Request wall | 4.450 s | **3.109 s** | 4.864 s |
| First token | 1.023 s | 1.179 s | not recorded in the raw comparison |
| Decode throughput | about 8.4 tok/s | included in speculative schedule | 7.11 tok/s |

The comparison establishes end-to-end behavior on this machine; it does not establish equal quantization quality. Full source pins, per-round timings and definitions are in `results.json` (kept with the benchmark records in the upstream `llm-in-c` repository), with a human-readable view in `REVIEW.html` (upstream).

## Apple stack comparison

The llama.cpp row above is not the strongest local stack on this machine. The
same five workloads were run through mlx-lm 0.31.3 / mlx 0.32.0 and oMLX 0.5.7
on 2026-08-18, both resident, greedy, one warmup first, against
`mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-4bit` — the same checkpoint this runtime compiles
its images from, with no requantization on either side (the DeltaNet Q8 weights comes 
from `mlx-community/Qwen3.8-27B-bf16` (54G)). Reply token counts
differ between stacks because the completions differ; this compares
throughput, not tokens.

| Workload | mlx-lm | oMLX | This runtime, plain | This runtime, adaptive MTP | MTP vs best MLX |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Code, short | 6.29 | 6.17 | 6.36 | **15.01** | 2.39× |
| Prose | 8.08 | 8.12 | 8.19 | **10.84** | 1.33× |
| Code, long | 8.36 | 8.30 | 7.98 | **17.59** | 2.10× |
| Essay | 8.46 | 8.45 | 8.01 | **9.94** | 1.17× |
| Summary | 7.26 | 7.33 | 6.99 | **9.87** | 1.35× |
| **Aggregate** | **8.29** | **8.28** | 7.96 | **11.95** | **1.44×** |

All values are end-to-end tokens/s: reply tokens over the full request wall,
including prefill. Aggregate walls are 398.1 s for mlx-lm, 398.0 s for oMLX,
415.0 s plain and 276.0 s speculative.

Without speculation this runtime is **0.96×** the best Apple stack, not ahead
of it. That result is expected rather than disappointing: 15.139 GB of mapped
weights over the 117–118 GB/s measured on this machine is a first-order
ceiling near 7.8 tokens/s for any decoder that reads every weight once per
token, and mlx-lm (8.29), oMLX (8.28) and the plain arm (7.96) all sit within
6% of it. Hand-written kernels cannot move a bound set by weight traffic.
Adaptive MTP clears it by amortizing one weight pass over several accepted
tokens, which is where the 1.44× aggregate and 2.10× long-code margins come
from.

Raw per-case output is in `set-mlxlm-38.json` (upstream)
and `set-omlx-38.json` (upstream); the
merged record is `apple_stack_comparison` in `results.json` (kept with the benchmark records in the upstream `llm-in-c` repository).
